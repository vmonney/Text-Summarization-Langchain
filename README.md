# Text Summarization with Langchain

This project is dedicated to creating a text summarization application using Langchain, a library for building language model chains. It leverages OpenAI's language models to summarize large blocks of text into concise, informative summaries.

## Overview

The project includes a Jupyter notebook (`Main.ipynb`) that demonstrates the process of setting up Langchain with OpenAI's API and creating a language model chain for text summarization. Additionally, it features a Streamlit application (`app.py`) for a more interactive experience.

## Features

- **Langchain Integration**: Utilizes Langchain to build a chain with OpenAI's language models for text summarization.
- **OpenAI API**: Leverages the OpenAI API for processing and summarizing text.
- **Streamlit App**: Includes a Streamlit application for an interactive text summarization experience.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Provides a detailed walkthrough of the setup and usage of Langchain for text summarization.

## Installation

To use this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vmonney/Text-Summarization-Langchain.git
cd Text-Summarization-Langchain
pip install langchain openai streamlit
```

## Usage

1. **Jupyter Notebook**: Explore `Main.ipynb` for a step-by-step guide on setting up Langchain and summarizing text.
2. **Streamlit App**: Run `app.py` to start the Streamlit application for an interactive summarization tool.
